# Aeonis — First Stable 26.1 Release (v4.0.0)

**Aeonis** is a multi-system Minecraft framework combining **mob possession**, **AI-assisted command systems**, **custom dimensions**, **unique mobs**, and **advanced rendering** into one unified experience.

---

## 🆕 What’s New in 4.0.0 — First Stable 26.1 Release

### ✅ Stable Release Milestone
- First non-snapshot stable release on Minecraft 26.1.
- 26.1.1 hotfix compatibility is supported while 26.1 remains the baseline requirement.
- Finalized migration line from 1.21.11 to 26.1 with snapshot stabilization completed.

### 🔁 26.1 Transition Summary
- Snapshot path completed: `4.0-SNAPSHOT5` -> `4.0-SNAPSHOT10`.
- Major stabilization areas: startup/runtime mixin compatibility, integrated server/world-load reliability, transformed camera + interaction behavior, and state cleanup.
- Warning policy remaster: startup spam removed, targeted WIP warnings retained only where needed.

---

## 🧭 Fabric 26.1 Porting Reference (Maintainer + AI)

This section is a structured internal reference for future Aeonis updates.
It summarizes major Fabric 26.1 migration guidance in actionable form.

### Source Context
- Based on the Fabric 26.1 ecosystem guidance and release communication (Mar 2026).
- Intended for maintainers, contributors, and AI-assisted update workflows.

### Core Reality of 26.1
- Minecraft 26.1 is unobfuscated.
- Mods from 1.21.11 and earlier do not run as-is; at minimum, recompilation is required.
- Official Mojang mappings are the expected baseline for Fabric 26.1 projects.

### Toolchain Baseline
- Loom: 1.15+
- Gradle: 9.4+
- Fabric Loader: latest stable for 26.1 line (minimum compatible release)
- Java: 25 minimum for Gradle JVM
- IntelliJ IDEA: 2025.3+ recommended for stable mixin IDE behavior

### Buildscript Migration Rules
- Use plugin: `net.fabricmc.fabric-loom` (unobfuscated workflow)
- Replace old remap-centric dependencies:
  - `modImplementation` -> `implementation`
  - `modCompileOnly` -> `compileOnly`
- Replace `remapJar`-centric assumptions with `jar` in pure unobfuscated workflows where applicable

### Fabric API Migration Notes
- `fabric` mod id dependency from Fabric API is no longer provided; depend on `fabric-api` correctly.
- Removed deprecated modules:
  - `fabric-convention-tags-v1`
  - `fabric-loot-api-v2`
- Deprecated HUD callback path replaced:
  - old: `HudRenderCallback`
  - new: `HudElementRegistry`
- Naming alignment with official mappings means API renames are required during migration.
  - example: `ItemGroupEvents` -> `CreativeModeTabEvents`

### New/Important Fabric Event Patterns
- Dimension attribute modification event is preferred over per-biome bulk patching for dimension-wide defaults.
- New finer-grained block/item interaction events exist for cleaner vanilla flow interception:
  - `BlockEvents.USE_ITEM_ON`
  - `BlockEvents.USE_WITHOUT_ITEM`
  - `ItemEvents.USE_ON`
  - `ItemEvents.USE`

### Rendering + Model Notes
- Legacy OpenGL-direct assumptions should be reduced; backend changes are expected beyond 26.1.
- Block color registration moved from broad legacy path to dedicated block color registry APIs.
- Terrain render layer behavior is increasingly automatic from sprite/model properties.

### Minecraft-Side 26.1 Data/Code Changes to Watch
- Item stack lifecycle changed: avoid creating/using certain stack data before world load; template-based patterns may be required.
- Recipe serializers moved toward codec-centric definitions.
- Villager trading is data-driven; prefer data pack registrations over older helper-only APIs.
- Fluid rendering flow moved toward fluid model registration patterns.

### Aeonis Update Checklist for Future Versions
1. Confirm Gradle + Loom + Java baseline first.
2. Verify mapping assumptions (official names) before touching gameplay code.
3. Run search for removed/deprecated Fabric API modules/events.
4. Audit mixin targets and signatures against current MC classes.
5. Validate worldgen/data pack references (registry keys must exist).
6. Run transformed gameplay regression pass (camera, interaction, untransform cleanup).
7. Update changelog + README migration notes before final release tag.

### Risk Warnings
- World format/storage and registry behavior can change across major lines: always back up test worlds.
- Rendering internals remain high churn during the 26.1 -> 26.2 era.
- Keep warning UX targeted: avoid login spam; notify only in specific WIP surfaces.

### Contributor Policy Reminder
- Do not pressure maintainers for same-day updates after major MC/Fabric jumps.
- Prefer reproducible issue reports with logs, mappings context, and exact mod list.

### 🎯 Prop Hunt Hotfix Remaster
- Fixed player leave/disconnect state restoration to prevent stuck disguise/inventory/gamemode issues
- Added stronger round-state validation (countdown cancellation when player count drops, start guards, duplicate round-end guards)
- Improved match accuracy with live arena border enforcement and online-player-aware win checks
- Added dynamic hint pacing in final minute for more consistent round pressure
- Added end-of-round rewards + achievement checks directly in round resolution
- Added first-blood and last-kill bonus hooks for hunter eliminations
- Fixed arena preset command flow (`/prophunt arena create <id> <preset>`) to actually create from preset
- Added `/prophunt settings hintinterval <seconds>` and hunter min/max validation

### 🧟 Copper Stalker AI Remaster
- Remastered Copper Stalker into a more advanced but fearful hunter species
- Added food-based temporary taming using vegetable foods (carrot/potato/beetroot family)
- Tamed stalkers stop attacking, follow their tamer, and automatically depart at morning with a goodbye message
- Added feeding-window behavior: both hostile and tamed stalkers pause aggression and watch nearby food-holding players
- Added advancement: `Taming liternally everything!`

### 🎭 Fun Command Remaster
- Added timed prank morph command powered by existing transform command flow:
  - `/prank morph <players> <chicken|pig|goat|frog|parrot|random_funny>`
  - Duration: 2 minutes, then auto-untransform
- Added new prank commands:
  - `/prank boing <players>`
  - `/prank confetti <players>`
  - `/prank swap <player_a> <player_b>`

### 🛠️ Development Note
